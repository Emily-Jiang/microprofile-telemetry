== Logs
The OpenTelemetry Logs bridge API exists to enable bridging logs from other log frameworks (e.g. SLF4J, Log4j, JUL, Logback, etc) into OpenTelemetry. It does not define new Log APIs and the Logs bridge APIs in OpenTelemetry are not for application but for runtime to bridge log frameworks. Therefore, this specification does not expose any Log APIs.
